# Notes

• Stay Consistent (You use finals in very random spots, and it is not consistent)
• Stop leaving spaces (Angers Kyle)
• We should probably stop using streams so much as it can cause a lot of lag issues (Kyle Smart, I know shocking)

# Common Issues
• When a player leaves the server they still exist in the match
• You can queue yourself (hilarious)

# TODO
• Add cooldowns
• Add elo system
• Finish the match system
• Leaderboards (RestAPI with Python is a possibility)
• Specator System
• StaffMode (Silent to detect cheaters)
• Tournaments
• Party System
• Clans
• Kit Editor
• Custom Events (Sumo, Spleef etc)
• Boxing gamemode (Easy to get people to advertise with tiktok & Youtube shorts)
